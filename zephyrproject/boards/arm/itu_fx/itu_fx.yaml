# a string matches how the board is defined in the build system.
# This same string is used when building,

# The actual name of the board as it appears in marketing material.
name: iTU-FX

# Type of the board or conﬁguration, currently we support 2 types: mcu, qemu
type: mcu

# Architecture of the board
arch: arm

# The list of supported toolchains that can build this board.
# This should match one of the values used for ‘ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT’ 
# when building on the command line
toolchain:
  - zephyr
  - gnuarmemb

# Available RAM on the board (speciﬁed in KB). 
# This is used to match testcase requirements.
# If not speciﬁed we default to 128KB.
ram: 128

# Available FLASH on the board (speciﬁed in KB). 
# This is used to match testcase requirements.
# If not speciﬁed we default to 512KB.
flash: 1024

# A list of features this board supports. This can be speciﬁed as a single word feature or as a variant of a
# feature class. For example:
# supported:
#   - pci
# This indicates the board does support PCI. You can make a testcase build or run only on such boards, or:
# supported:
#   - netif:eth
#   - sensor:bmi16
# A testcase can both depend on ‘eth’ to only test ethernet or on ‘netif’ to run on any board with a networking
# interface.

supported:
  - watchdog
  - gpio
  - spi
  - rtc


# testing relating keywords to provide best coverage for the features of this board.
# default: [True|False]: This is a default board, it will tested with the highest priority and is covered when
#      invoking the simpliﬁed sanitycheck without any additional arguments.
# ignore_tags: Do not attempt to build (and therefore run) tests marked with this list of tags.
